# TrelloAutomation.API
.NET API for Trello Automation (my Trello structure will be posted soon as templates in Trello and research paper)

## About the project

It helps to automate some tasks for personal productivity. I created a structure in Trello that helps keeping track of every aspect of my life.
Myy Trello has daily, weekly, monthly and annual performance reports that help me to make better decisions, but it has so many routine manual tasks that automating them became necessary.
